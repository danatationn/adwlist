# AdwList

a stylesheet aiming to make FileList look more modern

the general look is taken from the adwaita design language, hence the name

Note this isn't trying to completely imitate it as that would take way too long i just want it to look like it

## installation


first install a theming extension like stylus

1. download the repo
2. run `main.py`
3. a file named `style.css` should appear
4. stick it in a css extension thingy like `Stylus`
5. Acquire and eat `booty` (I think that's what pirates say??)
