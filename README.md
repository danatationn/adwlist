# AdwList

a stylesheet aiming to make FileList look more modern

the general look is taken from the adwaita design language, hence the name

Note this isn't trying to completely imitate it as that would take way too long i just want it to look like it

## roadmap
- [ ] everything on the site being replaced
- [ ] custom icons
- [ ] general polishing
- [ ] different palletes
- [ ] custom border-radius
- [ ] custom font
- [ ] the navbar in the sidebar or Not

## compiling
1. download the repo
2. install [dart-sass](https://sass-lang.com/install/) (the command-line one)
3. run `main.py`
4. a file named `style.css` should appear
5. stick it in a css extension thingy like `Stylus`
6. Acquire and eat `booty` (I think that's what pirates say??)
